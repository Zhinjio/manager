# What is it like to report to me?  

I've seen a variety of posted files recently that looked very similar describing a manager (or team lead's) style of managing, what they consider important, and some facts about them. I do love the idea behind it, but not the presentation. So here's my attempt at my own. Also, I consider this the content of my first face-to-face discussion with you, the new employee, as part of the overall orientation to your new role.

# Basic values

## Honesty
Real simple. I won't lie to you. There may be times when I can't say things because of legal restrictions or requests for confidentiality. But if you ask me a direct question, I will give you a direct answer. I expect the same of you. Which leads to the next value...
## Ownership
I've seen this referred to as DRI (Directly Responsibile Individual), which is apparently an Apple concept. I'm not sure I'm fully on board with it in that context, since I've never worked there and don't know how it manifests. But what it means to me is two things. First, you own up to your mistakes. If something goes sideways, I want to hear about it from you. **First**. It is much easier to explain to a peer manager or higher up "Yes, I'm aware of what happened, here's what we did to fix it, here's what we're doing to prevent it from happening again" than "Gee... uh, not sure... I'll have to get back to you on that".

Second, it means you own your career and growth. Yes, I'm here to help, and make sure any opportunities the company is willing to sponsor are made available to you, but I can't force you to learn, grow or be invested in your development and long term success. **YOU** own that. I will further state that people who aren't invested in growth are a pretty serious turn off to me. I feel most comfortable interacting with people who are just as excited about technology and learning as I am (or more!)

# Roles

I have a very good friend and mentor who summarized being a manager into three things. He said "you have to be an umbrella, snowplow and toolshed". He lives in Minnesota, so it was snowplow instead of bulldozer, but you get the idea. "Get me the tools I need, clear the way for me and keep it from raining on me". I do think there is more to it than that, but those three things are essential, and I endeavor to excel at those things.

I think that being a technical manager, that I bring more to the table than someone who isn't. I can be a technical mentor, especially for someone new to the job, but ultimately, I expect that you'll all eventually (or already) know quite a bit more about the technical aspects of your job than I do. That just goes with the territory. That doesn't mean I don't want you to come to me with technical problems. I can be a sounding board for your thoughts and ideas, and might also be able to steer you to resources that can help you further. The holdover from my own technical contributor roles is that I bring some fairly sharp problem solving skills to the table too, so let me exercise them once in awhile!

# Quirks

* I try to be concise with words. That goes for all forms of communication. That sometimes means that I sometimes mull over my response to questions or problems before presenting my thoughts. Please grant me the time to respond in my own time.
* Spelling and grammar matter. If you ask me to review a document or email, you can expect that I'll nitpick about these things. I apologize up front. It is just the way my brain works. There are several things I'm a little obsessive about, and this is one of them. 
* On the insights scale, I'm blue-green. Briggs-Meyers, INTJ. If those things don't matter to you, don't worry about it. If they do, maybe they give you some clues on how to interact with me. Personally, I find them to be useful guides, but certainly not an immutable contract with other people. Humans are complex, and don't often boil down to letters and numbers very well.
* Don't use the phrase "But that is the way we've always done it".

# Expectations

Some companies I've worked for have a separate Employee Expectations document, and this is the part of orientation where we'll review that. If not, here are some quick guidelines:
* Put in your time. Yes, there are lots of ways to be flexible with it (flex time, WFH, comp time, etc) but I will still expect that you are normally available during core hours to be available to your customers and peers. Be conscientious about letting others know when you can't/won't be available and mark your calendar as such. Give as much advance notice to me for planned and unplanned absences.
* Be professional. Be courteous and mindful in your treatment of others. I don't want to visit HR any more than you do. On the other side of that coin, if you feel someone else has behaved against those rules, come see me immediately. I will make sure your complaint is handled fairly, without retribution and promptly.
* Be a sound financial steward for the company. Pretend it is your own money the company is spending. Question (politely) the rationale of something if you see the company taking an unreasonable expense or risk. Remember that you may not have all the information involved in the decision.
* Be an advocate for your users. Don't ignore the downstream impact of your work, even though you might be making things easier for yourself or your team.
* Meet your commitments and deadlines. Let me know as soon as possible when you believe that dates will slip.
* I do **NOT** expect that we will always agree. In fact, I'd be more worried if we did. Be open to discussion and debate on topics and ideas, even if (or maybe especially if) they're firmly held. Commit bravely. Get on board once a decision is made. Learn from mistakes (yours and others). 

# 1 on 1's

I find them useful. They serve a variety of purposes, depending on the type of work you're currently doing, and how involved I am. Generally though, my agenda is:
* An opportunity for me to share anything from "upstream" that I think is important for you to know (mgmt carry-down)
* I want to know if anything is blocking you from getting your job done (see snowplow comment above)
* Progress on your professional growth goals (and any new goals you want to strive toward)

Some other common topics that are fair game (coming from either of us):
* Concerns about your performance, compensation, benefits or behavior
* Concerns about my performance or behavior (I do appreciate feedback)
* Thoughts about company direction, products/services, and strategy
* Thoughts on anything that both of us are excited about that is going on recently. These may or may not be work related.

# Personal history

I'm sure more of this will come out as we get to know each other, but here are some biographicals:
* I'm happily married with two kids (girl and boy). My wife is a pharmacist, and my kids are spoiled monsters who I usually manage to prevent from injuring each other. 
* I was born in Vienna, Austria, but grew up in the States. I've lived in New York, Florida, Ohio and Colorado. I'm pretty sure I've visited all the US states except Alaska, at least on a drive through. 
* I've worked for a variety of companies, big and small. Citrix (Test Engineer), 2 different small internet providers (Sysadmin), Hunter Douglas (Systems Engineer), SUN (Technical Instructor and Data Center Architect), eBay (Technical Duty Officer and NOC Manager), Intrado/West Safety Services (Systems Engineer, Supervisor and Manager). I even worked for the Psychic Discovery Network for a very short time, long ago. Ask me about it sometime over a beer.
* I am a gamer. Board games, PC, Console, RPG.
* I'm an avid reader. Primarily science fiction, alternative fiction and fantasy, but I'll read just about anything if the topic is good.
* Fan of: Star Wars, LEGO, Science, Photography, Astronomy, Maps, Books, Technology, Gastronomy, Craft Beer, and good Whiskey. Sometimes, more than one of those at once.
